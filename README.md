# Video Game Sales Analysis (COMP 6150)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to use my knowledge acquired from this class and perform some simple data analysis on a dataset about video game sales. The reason I chose a video game sales dataset is that I love to play video games and have an interest in game development. I wanted to use this project as an excuse to do some investigation on game development, finding out what makes or breaks a game.

Through out this project, I will be trying to answer these 3 questions:

1.   Which platform has the highest game sales?
2.   Which column affect sales the most?
3.   Which year has the highest amount of game sales?



## Selection of Data

The processing of the data are conducted using Jupyter Notebok and is available [here](code/VideoGameSales_Analysis.ipynb).
